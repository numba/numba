Numba is a NumPy aware optimizing compiler for Python.  It uses the
remarkable LLVM compiler infrastructure to compile Python byte-code to
machine code especially for use in the NumPy run-time and SciPy
modules.

Dependencies:

  * LLVM 3.1
  * llvm-py (from ContinuumIO/llvm-py fork)
  * numpy

* Compile LLVM 3.1 (unreleased) --- get it from svn: 

svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm
./configure --enable-optimized
# Be sure your compiler architecture is same as version of Python you will use
#  e.g. -arch i386 or -arch x86_64.  It might be best to be explicit about this.
make install


* Clone LLVM-py from github
git clone git://github.com/ContinuumIO/llvm-py.git
python setup.py install

* Build Numba
python setup.py install
