Release Notes
======================

Version 0.14
------------

Features:

* Support for nearly all the Numpy math functions (including comparison, 
  logical, bitwise and some previously missing float functions) in nopython mode.
* The Numpy datetime64 and timedelta64 dtypes are supported in nopython mode 
  with Numpy 1.7 and later.
* Support for Numpy math functions on complex numbers in nopython mode.
* ndarray.sum() is supported in nopython mode.
* Better error messages when unsupported types are used in Numpy math functions.
* Set NUMBA_WARNINGS=1 in the environment to see which functions are compiled
  in object mode vs. nopython mode.
* Add support for the two-argument pow() builtin function in nopython mode.
* New developer documentation describing how Numba works, and how to
  add new types.
* Support for Numpy record arrays on the GPU. (Note: Improper alignment of dtype
  fields will cause an exception to be raised.)
* Slices on GPU device arrays.
* GPU objects can be used as Python context managers to select the active
  device in a block.
* GPU device arrays can be bound to a CUDA stream.  All subsequent operations
  (such as memory copies) will be queued on that stream instead of the default.
  This can prevent unnecessary synchronization with other streams.

Fixes:

* Generation of AVX instructions has been disabled to avoid performance bugs
  when calling external math functions that may use SSE instructions, 
  especially on OS X.
* JIT functions can be removed by the garbage collector when they are no
  longer accessible.
* Various other reference counting fixes to prevent memory leaks.
* Fixed handling of exception when input argument is out of range.
* Prevent autojit functions from making unsafe numeric conversions when
  called with different numeric types.
* Fix a compilation error when an unhashable global value is accessed.
* Gracefully handle failure to enable faulthandler in the IPython Notebook.
* Fix a bug that caused loop lifting to fail if the loop was inside an
  ``else`` block.
* Fixed a problem with selecting CUDA devices in multithreaded programs on 
  Linux.
* The ``pow()`` function (and ``**`` operation) applied to two integers now 
  returns an integer rather than a float.
* Numpy arrays using the object dtype no longer cause an exception in the
  autojit.
* Attempts to write to a global array will cause compilation to fall back
  to object mode, rather than attempt and fail at nopython mode.
* ``range()`` works with all negative arguments (ex: ``range(-10, -12, -1)``)

  in nopython mode

Fixes:

* Support for NVIDIA compute capability 5.0 devices (such as the GTX 750)
* Vectorize no longer crashes/gives an error when bool\_ is used as return type
* Return the correct dictionary when globals() is used in JIT functions

Version 0.12.2
--------------

Fixes:

* Improved NumPy ufunc support in nopython mode
* Misc bug fixes


Version 0.12.1
--------------

This version fixed many regressions reported by user for the 0.12 release.
This release contains a new loop-lifting mechanism that specializes certains
loop patterns for nopython mode compilation.  This avoid direct support
for heap-allocating and other very dynamic operations.

Improvements:

* Add loop-lifting--jit-ing loops in nopython for object mode code. This allows
  functions to allocate NumPy arrays and use Python objects, while the tight
  loops in the function can still be compiled in nopython mode. Any arrays that
  the tight loop uses should be created before the loop is entered.

Fixes:

* Add support for majority of "math" module functions
* Fix for...else handling
* Add support for builtin round()
* Fix tenary if...else support
* Revive "numba" script
* Fix problems with some boolean expressions
* Add support for more NumPy ufuncs


Version 0.12
------------

Version 0.12 contains a big refactor of the compiler. The main objective for
this refactor was to simplify the code base to create a better foundation for
further work. A secondary objective was to improve the worst case performance
to ensure that compiled functions in object mode never run slower than pure
Python code (this was a problem in several cases with the old code base). This
refactor is still a work in progress and further testing is needed.

Main improvements:

* Major refactor of compiler for performance and maintenance reasons
* Better fallback to object mode when native mode fails
* Improved worst case performance in object mode

The public interface of numba has been slightly changed. The idea is to
make it cleaner and more rational:

* jit decorator has been modified, so that it can be called without a signature.
  When called without a signature, it behaves as the old autojit. Autojit
  has been deprecated in favour of this approach.
* Jitted functions can now be overloaded.
* Added a "njit" decorator that behaves like "jit" decorator with nopython=True.
* The numba.vectorize namespace is gone. The vectorize decorator will
  be in the main numba namespace.
* Added a guvectorize decorator in the main numba namespace. It is
  similiar to numba.vectorize, but takes a dimension signature. It
  generates gufuncs. This is a replacement for the GUVectorize gufunc
  factory which has been deprecated.

Main regressions (will be fixed in a future release):

* Creating new NumPy arrays is not supported in nopython mode
* Returning NumPy arrays is not supported in nopython mode
* NumPy array slicing is not supported in nopython mode
* lists and tuples are not supported in nopython mode
* string, datetime, cdecimal, and struct types are not implemented yet
* Extension types (classes) are not supported in nopython mode
* Closures are not supported
* Raise keyword is not supported
* Recursion is not support in nopython mode
