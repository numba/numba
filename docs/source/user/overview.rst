Overview
========

Numba is a compiler for Python array and numerical functions that gives 
you the power to speed up your applications with high performance
functions written directly in Python.

Numba generates optimized machine code from pure Python code using
the `LLVM compiler infrastructure <http://llvm.org/>`_.  With a few simple
annotations, array-oriented and math-heavy Python code can be
just-in-time optimized to performance similar as C, C++ and Fortran, without
having to switch languages or Python interpreters.

Numba's main features are:

* :ref:`on-the-fly code generation <jit>` (at import time or runtime, at the
  user's preference)
* native code generation for the CPU (default) and
  :doc:`GPU hardware </cuda/index>`
* integration with the Python scientific software stack (thanks to Numpy)

Here is how a Numba-optimized function, taking a Numpy array as argument,
might look like::

   @numba.jit
   def sum2d(arr):
       M, N = arr.shape
       result = 0.0
       for i in range(M):
           for j in range(N):
               result += arr[i,j]
       return result
