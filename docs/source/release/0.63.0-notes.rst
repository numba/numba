Version 0.63.0 (Release Date)
=============================


New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initial support for free-threading enabled Python
-------------------------------------------------

The Numba code base now supports the CPython interpreter built with
free-threading enabled. Note that this feature is experimental and subject to
further development.

Also note that the deprecated ``numba.pycc`` module does not support the
creation of free-threaded AOT compiled modules.

(`PR-#10226 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10226>`__)

Add support for ``math.exp2``.
------------------------------

Support for ``math.exp2`` is added.

(`PR-#10276 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10276>`__)


Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for Python 3.14
-----------------------

Support for Python 3.14 is implemented.

(`PR-#10150 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10150>`__)


CUDA API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fix CUDA target crash bug with NVIDIA driver version 580
--------------------------------------------------------

Fixes a bug in the CUDA driver wrapper that caused the CUDA target to
crash with NVIDIA driver version 580 and later.  This was already
fixed in the `numba-cuda` package, but has been backported here for
users who haven't migrated yet.  (We still encourage all CUDA users to
switch to the `numba-cuda` package for the most up to date CUDA
support in Numba.)

(`PR-#10237 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10237>`__)


Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Fix the caching of functions that call parallel=True functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, reload_init, which keeps track of functions that need to
be called when reloading a module, was only maintained for the current
function but not called functions.  So, if the called function needed
something reloaded and the parent function was cached then the reload
would not happen.  This has been fixed by propagating the reload_init
up the call chain.

(`PR-#9950 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/9950>`__)

Make ``types.ListType`` string representation evaluable
-------------------------------------------------------

Fix ``types.ListType`` canonical string representation by making it evaluable.
This changes ``str()`` to ``repr()`` call for obtaining string representation of
the list's element.

(`PR-#10195 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10195>`__)

Fix UnboundLocalError when calling copy on non-Array types
----------------------------------------------------------

Enables calling np.copy inside a jitted function with non-Array 
arguments, such as lists or scalars, and fails with a readable
error message on incoercible types

(`PR-#10201 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10201>`__)

Fix ``np.ndenumerate`` support for zero-dimensional arrays
----------------------------------------------------------

``np.ndenumerate()`` now correctly handles zero-dimensional arrays in 
JIT-compiled functions. Previously this would raise an ``IndexError``.

(`PR-#10288 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10288>`__)

Fix gufunc memory leak when called from JIT-compiled functions
--------------------------------------------------------------

Fix memory leak in gufuncs when called from within `@jit` functions.
The issue was caused by incorrect reference counting in the gufunc loopnest
that increment reference count of array slices.

(`PR-#10298 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10298>`__)


Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deprecation of macOS x86-64 (Intel) support
---------------------------------------------

Official support for the Intel x86_64 macOS platform (also known as osx-64)
has been deprecated and moved to Tier 2 under the :ref:`Support Tiers
<support_tiers>` policy. Continuous integration will no longer test this
platform and new releases will not include binary artifacts for osx-64.
The platform remains in the source tree and may continue to work based on
community reports.

Users on Intel Macs should use the last officially supported release (0.62.x).
See :issue:`10187` for more details.

(`PR-#10187 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10187>`__)


Documentation Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Document the Numba organisation hardware/OS/packaging etc. support policy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation is added to provide clarity over what OS/hardware/packaging etc.
is supported by projects in the Numba organisation.

(`PR-#10283 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/10283>`__)
