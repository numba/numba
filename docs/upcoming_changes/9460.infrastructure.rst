Initial development on performance testing suite
------------------------------------------------

Initial development work has begun on a performance testing suite, aka 
_perfsuite_. The goal is to migrate existing benchmarks from the separate 
https://github.com/numba/numba-benchmark repository into the main codebase. 
This will allow performance testing to be run regularly as part of continuous 
integration. Regular automated testing will help ensure performance regressions 
are quickly identified as code changes are made.
