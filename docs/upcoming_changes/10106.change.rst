Fix list comprehension support for Python 3.13.4
------------------------------------------------

Python 3.13.4 introduced a change in the bytecode generated for generator
expressions, which also affects list comprehensions. 
See `python/cpython#135171<https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/135171>_`
for details. Numba relied on pattern matching the previous bytecode sequence,
which no longer matched after the change. This update restores compatibility.
