Improve CFG algo performance
----------------------------

Improve performance of some CFG algorithms so that large graphs 
can be parsed faster and without throwing recursion errors.

Implemented by switching to a stack-based implementation for CFGraph._find_topo_order
and building dominators/post-dominators from a DFS on "immediate dominators".
