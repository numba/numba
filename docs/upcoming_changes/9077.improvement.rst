First-class function improvements
---------------------------------

Passing a jit function as a parameter to another jit function that accepts it as
a ``FunctionType`` has two new improvements.

First, the compiler can now inline a jit function that is passed as a non-local 
variable (like a global variable) to another jit function. Previously, the 
interpreter had to introspect the function address for first-class function 
calls, which prevented inlining. With this improvement, the compiler can 
statically determine the referenced jit function and link in the corresponding 
LLVM module for optimization, bypassing the need for the GIL entirely.

Second, jit functions used as first-class functions can now raise exceptions. 
Before this improvement, they were subject to the same restrictions as 
``@cfunc`` decorated functions, where any exceptions raised were ignored.
