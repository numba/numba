Enhance guvectorize support in JIT code
---------------------------------------

Generalized universal function support is extended, it is now possible to call
a ``@guvectorize`` decorated function from within a JIT-compiled function.
However, please note that broadcasting is not supported yet. Calling a
guvectorize function in a scenario where broadcast is needed may result in
incorrect behavior.
