[DUX] fix use of rstcheck in towncrier check script
---------------------------------------------------

The script ``maint/towncrier_rst_validator.py`` now correctly reports any RST
issues encountered when calling ``rstcheck`` via ``subprocess.chck_output``.
This helps to improve the developer experience as any issues are reported
directly and the developers no longer need to be confused and/or run a
secondary tools
