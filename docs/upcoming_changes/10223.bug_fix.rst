Fix scalar handling in ``numpy.all``
------------------------------------

Fixed scalar handling in the ``numpy.all`` function. Previously, this
function would fail when called with scalar inputs. Now it properly handles
both scalar and array inputs, converting scalars to boolean values as
expected.
