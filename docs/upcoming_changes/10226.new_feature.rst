Initial support for free-threading enabled Python
-------------------------------------------------

The Numba code base now supports the CPython interpreter built with
free-threading enabled. Note that this feature is experimental and subject to
further development.

Also note that the deprecated ``numba.pycc`` module does not support the
creation of free-threaded AOT compiled modules.
