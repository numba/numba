Added initial implementation for a new type system.
---------------------------------------------------

This adds a new type system that will allow Numba to
differentiate between Python and NumPy scalars.

This has been achieved as follows:

- Retain Numba's old type system as default.
- Add a config flag `USE_LEGACY_TYPE_SYSTEM` set to `1` (on) by default.
  Switching it to `0` (off) will activate new type system.
- Within the new type system, Python and NumPy scalars will be treated
  and returned separately as different entities through JIT compiled functions.
