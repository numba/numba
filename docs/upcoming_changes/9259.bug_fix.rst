Avoid type inference hangs
--------------------------

Type inference can take a long time if it repeatedly attempts to resolve
functions that have already failed. A patch is added to cache failed
resolutions for the current compilation session. 

This changes compiler behavior in the following way:

- Previously, if a function resolution imported new extensions, those 
  extensions could add support for the failing function. 

- Now, the compiler will not retry failed resolutions, so new extensions
  added during function resolution cannot add support retroactively.

It is important to note importing of extensions during function resolution phase
are unexpected. They should be avoided as they can cause confusing behavior. 

To help isolate any issues arising from this change, an environment variable
``NUMBA_DISABLE_TYPEINFER_FAIL_CACHE`` is added to disable the cache.
