Improvements in how Pass Manager objects are created for optimizations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Move creation of ``ModulePassManager`` object to ``_optimize_final_module``
function, preventing the usage of the same pass manager object for
compiling multiple Python functions. This would allow for better control
while optimizing unrelated modules and possibly under different settings
(degree of vectorization, optimization level, etc.).
