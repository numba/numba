Fix automatic unwrapping of optional type
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Previously, if an extension code (e.g. ``@overload``) raises a ``TypingError``
due to the lack of support of optional type, there were no automatic unwrapping 
of the  optional typed arguments. However, if the extension code rejects by
returning ``None``, automatic unwrapping is done. This is now fixed.
