Add compile-time assertion intrinsics
-------------------------------------

Add ``numba.core.unsafe.asserts.assert_not_typing(msg)`` and 
``numba.core.unsafe.asserts.assert_not_lowering(msg)`` intrinics that functions
like a C `#error` directive for detecting when JIT code is unexpectedly entering
type-inference and lowering, respectively. These are useful for debugging 
and asserting behavior dead-code elimination.
