NumPy 2.0 Binary Support
------------------------

Added Binary Support for NumPy 2.0. However, this does not yet include
NEP 50 related type-level changes which are still in progress.

Following is a summary of the user facing changes:

* The ``ptp()`` method previously available for arrays has been deprecated. 
  Instead, it is recommended to use the ``np.ptp(arr)`` function.
* The data type ``np.bool8`` has been deprecated and replaced with ``np.bool``. 
* The ``np.product`` function is deprecated; users are advised to use 
  ``np.prod`` instead.
* Starting from NumPy version 2.0, the ``itemset()`` method has been removed 
  from the ``ndarray`` class. To achieve the same functionality, utilize 
  the assignment operation ``arr[index] = value``.
* Deprecated constants ``np.PINF`` and ``np.NINF`` should be replaced with 
  ``np.inf`` for positive infinity and ``-np.inf`` for negative infinity, 
  respectively.
