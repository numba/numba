Fix ParallelAccelerator hoisting logic bug
------------------------------------------

A bug in the hoisting logic of the ParallelAccelerator is fixed.
The bug caused invalid hoisting of operations that depended on non-hoistable
operations, leading to incorrect execution. With this fix, the hoisting logic
now correctly identifies and handles dependencies on non-hoistable operations,
ensuring that operations are hoisted and executed correctly.
