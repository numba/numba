Fix support for overloading dispatcher with non-compatible first-class functions
================================================================================

Fixes an error caused by not handling compilation error during casting of 
``Dispatcher`` objects into first-class functions. With the fix, users can now
overload a dispatcher with non-compatible first-class functions. Refer to
