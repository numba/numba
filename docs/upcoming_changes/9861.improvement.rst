Fall back to ``inspect.getsourcelines()`` in first line finder
--------------------------------------------------------------

If the first line finder can't locate source code on disk, it now tries using
``inspect.getsourcelines()`` to get the source. This enables it to locate
source for cells in Jupyter notebooks, so that line info for them can be
generated for profiling tools.
