Deprecation of macOS x86-64 (Intel) support
---------------------------------------------

Official support for the Intel x86_64 macOS platform (also known as osx-64)
has been deprecated and moved to Tier 2 under the :ref:`Support Tiers
<support_tiers>` policy. Continuous integration will no longer test this
platform and new releases will not include binary artifacts (wheels) for osx-64.
The platform remains in the source tree and may continue to work based on
community reports.

Users on Intel Macs should use the last officially supported release (0.62.x).
See :issue:`10187` for more details.
