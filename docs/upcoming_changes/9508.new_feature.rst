Added compile-time code coverage
--------------------------------

Support for emitting compile-time coverage data is added.
This feature is automatically activated when running Python under ``coverage``. 
It collects data during the compiler's lowering phase, showing source lines 
compiled into LLVM-IR, excluding dead-code eliminated lines.
