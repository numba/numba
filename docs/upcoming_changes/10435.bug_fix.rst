Fix scalar handling in ``np.min`` and ``np.max``
------------------------------------------------

Fix scalar handling in ``np.min`` and ``np.max`` functions. Previously, these functions would
fail when called with scalar inputs. They now properly handle both scalar
and array inputs, returning the original value when a scalar is provided.
