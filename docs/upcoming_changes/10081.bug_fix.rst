Fix deprecation warning caused by ``tostring()`` in structured record constant
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Replaces the deprecated usage of ``tostring()`` with ``tobytes()`` in
``numba/np/arrayobj.py:constant_record``. This resolves a DeprecationWarning
raised when creating structured record constants under recent versions of NumPy.
