Greater control over compilation of ``jitclass`` members
--------------------------------------------------------

Previously, all methods on a ``jitclass`` were compiled using ``jit`` with only
``nopython=True`` passed as a keyword argument. Now, with this PR, the 
``jitclass`` decorator accepts the same keyword arguments as ``njit`` to control
compilation of the class's methods. In addition, a new ``jitmethod`` decorator
has been added to allow some methods to use different keyword arguments than the
surrounding ``jitclass``.
