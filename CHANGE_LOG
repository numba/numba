Version 0.6.1
--------------
* Support for bitwise operations

Version 0.6
--------------
* Python 2.6 support
* Programmable typing
    * Allow users to add type inference for external code
* Better NumPy type inference
    * outer, inner, dot, vdot, tensordot, nonzero, where,
      binary ufuncs + methods (reduce, accumulate, reduceat, outer)
* Type based alias analysis
    * Support for strict aliasing
* Much faster autojit dispatch when calling from Python
* Faster numerical loops through data and stride pre-loading
* Integral overflow and underflow checking for conversions from objects

Version 0.5
--------------
* SSA-based type inference
    * Allows variable reuse
    * Allow referring to variables before lexical definition
* Support multiple comparisons
* Support for template types
* List comprehensions
* Support for pointers
* Many bug fixes

Version 0.4
--------------

Version 0.3.2
--------------

* Add support for object arithmetic (issue 56).
* Bug fixes (issue 55).

Version 0.3
--------------
* Changed default compilation approach to ast
* Added support for cross-module linking
* Added support for closures (can jit inner functions and return them) (see examples/closure.py)
* Added support for dtype structures (can access elements of structure with attribute access) (see examples/structures.py)
* Added support for extension types (numba classes) (see examples/numbaclasses.py)
* Added support for general Python code (use nopython to raise an error if Python C-API is used to avoid unexpected slowness because of lack of implementation defaulting to generic Python)
* Fixed many bugs
* Added support to detect math operations. 
* Added with python and with nopython contexts
* Added more examples

Many features need to be documented still.  Look at examples and tests for more information.


Version 0.2
--------------
* Added an ast approach to compilation
* Removed d, f, i, b from numba namespace (use f8, f4, i4, b1)
* Changed function to autojit2
* Added autojit function to decorate calls to the function and use types of the variable to create compiled versions. 
* changed keyword arguments to jit and autojit functions to restype and argtypes to be consistent with ctypes module.
* Added pycc -- a python to shared library compiler
