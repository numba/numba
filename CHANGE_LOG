Version 0.39.0
--------------

Here are the highlights for the Numba 0.39.0 release.

* This is the first version that supports Python 3.7.
* With help from Intel, we have fixed the issues with SVML support (related
  issues #2938, #2998, #3006).
* List has gained support for containing reference-counted types like NumPy
  arrays and `list`.  Note, list still cannot hold heterogeneous types.
* We have made a significant change to the internal calling-convention,
  which should be transparent to most users, to allow for a future feature that
  will permitting jumping back into python-mode from a nopython-mode function.
  This also fixes a limitation to `print` that disabled its use from nopython
  functions that were deep in the call-stack.
* For CUDA GPU support, we added a `__cuda_array_interface__` following the
  NumPy array interface specification to allow Numba to consume externally
  defined device arrays.  We have opened a corresponding pull request to CuPy to
  test out the concept and be able to use a CuPy GPU array.
* The Numba dispatcher `inspect_types()` method now supports the kwarg `pretty`
  which if set to `True` will produce ANSI/HTML output, showing the annotated
  types, when invoked from ipython/jupyter-notebook respectively.
* The NumPy functions `ndarray.dot`, `np.percentile` and `np.nanpercentile`, and
  `np.unique` are now supported.
* Numba now supports the use of a per-project configuration file to permanently
  set behaviours typically set via `NUMBA_*` family environment variables.
* Support for the `ppc64le` architecture has been added.

Version 0.38.1
--------------

This is a critical bug fix release addressing:
https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3006

The bug does not impact users using conda packages from Anaconda or Intel Python
Distribution (but it does impact conda-forge). It does not impact users of pip
using wheels from PyPI.

This only impacts a small number of users where:

 * The ICC runtime (specifically libsvml) is present in the user's environment.
 * The user is using an llvmlite statically linked against a version of LLVM
   that has not been patched with SVML support.
 * The platform is 64-bit.

The release fixes a code generation path that could lead to the production of
incorrect results under the above situation.

Fixes:

* PR #3007: Augment SVML detection with llvmlite SVML patch detection.

Version 0.38.0
--------------

Following on from the bug fix focus of the last release, this release swings
back towards the addition of new features and usability improvements based on
community feedback. This release is comparatively large! Three key features/
changes to note are:

 * Numba (via llvmlite) is now backed by LLVM 6.0, general vectorization is
   improved as a result. A significant long standing LLVM bug that was causing
   corruption was also found and fixed.
 * Further considerable improvements in vectorization are made available as
   Numba now supports Intel's short vector math library (SVML).
   Try it out with `conda install -c numba icc_rt`.
 * CUDA 8.0 is now the minimum supported CUDA version.

Other highlights include:
 
 * Bug fixes to `parallel=True` have enabled more vectorization opportunities
   when using the ParallelAccelerator technology.
 * Much effort has gone into improving error reporting and the general usability
   of Numba. This includes highlighted error messages and performance tips
   documentation. Try it out with `conda install colorama`.
 * A number of new NumPy functions are supported, `np.convolve`, `np.correlate`
   `np.reshape`, `np.transpose`, `np.permutation`, `np.real`, `np.imag`, and
   `np.searchsorted` now supports the`side` kwarg. Further, `np.argsort` now
   supports the `kind` kwarg with `quicksort` and `mergesort` available.
 * The Numba extension API has gained the ability operate more easily with
   functions from Cython modules through the use of
   `numba.extending.get_cython_function_address` to obtain function addresses
   for direct use in `ctypes.CFUNCTYPE`.
 * Numba now allows the passing of jitted functions (and containers of jitted
   functions) as arguments to other jitted functions.
 * The CUDA functionality has gained support for a larger selection of bit
   manipulation intrinsics, also SELP, and has had a number of bugs fixed.
 * Initial work to support the PPC64LE platform has been added, full support is
   however waiting on the LLVM 6.0.1 release as it contains critical patches
   not present in 6.0.0.
   It is hoped that any remaining issues will be fixed in the next release.
 * The capacity for advanced users/compiler engineers to define their own
   compilation pipelines.

Version 0.36.2
--------------

This is a bugfix release that provides minor changes to address:

* PR #2645: Avoid CPython bug with ``exec`` in older 2.7.x.
* PR #2652: Add support for CUDA 9.


Version 0.36.1
--------------

This release continues to add new features to the work undertaken in partnership
with Intel on ParallelAccelerator technology. Other changes of note include the
compilation chain being updated to use LLVM 5.0 and the production of conda
packages using conda-build 3 and the new compilers that ship with it.

NOTE: A version 0.36.0 was tagged for internal use but not released.

ParallelAccelerator:

NOTE: The ParallelAccelerator technology is under active development and should
be considered experimental.

New features relating to ParallelAccelerator, from work undertaken with Intel,
include the addition of the `@stencil` decorator for ease of implementation of
stencil-like computations, support for general reductions, and slice and
range fusion for parallel slice/bit-array assignments. Documentation on both the
use and implementation of the above has been added. Further, a new debug
environment variable `NUMBA_DEBUG_ARRAY_OPT_STATS` is made available to give
information about which operators/calls are converted to parallel for-loops.

ParallelAccelerator features:

* PR #2457: Stencil Computations in ParallelAccelerator
* PR #2548: Slice and range fusion, parallelizing bitarray and slice assignment
* PR #2516: Support general reductions in ParallelAccelerator

* PR #2605: Fixes issue #2603.

Additional features of note:

This release of Numba (and llvmlite) is updated to use LLVM version 5.0 as the
compiler back end, the main change to Numba to support this was the addition of
a custom symbol tracker to avoid the calls to LLVM's `ExecutionEngine` that was
crashing when asking for non-existent symbol addresses. Further, the conda
packages for this release of Numba are built using conda build version 3 and the
new compilers/recipe grammar that are present in that release.

* PR #2568: Update for LLVM 5
* PR #2607: Fixes abort when getting address to "nrt_unresolved_abort"

Version 0.35.0
--------------

This release includes some exciting new features as part of the work
performed in partnership with Intel on ParallelAccelerator technology.
There are also some additions made to Numpy support and small but
significant fixes made as a result of considerable effort spent chasing bugs
and implementing stability improvements.


ParallelAccelerator:

NOTE: The ParallelAccelerator technology is under active development and should
be considered experimental.

New features relating to ParallelAccelerator, from work undertaken with Intel,
include support for a larger range of `np.random` functions in `parallel`
mode, printing Numpy arrays in no Python mode, the capacity to initialize Numpy
arrays directly from list comprehensions, and the axis argument to `.sum()`.
Documentation on the ParallelAccelerator technology implementation has also
been added. Further, a large amount of work on equivalence relations was
undertaken to enable runtime checks of broadcasting behaviours in parallel mode.

mode is added. Further, three new environment variables are added, two for
overriding CPU target/features and another to warn if `parallel=True` was set
no such transform was possible.

* PR #2490: Implement np.take and ndarray.take
* PR #2493: Display a warning if parallel=True is set but not possible.
* PR #2513: Add np.MachAr, np.finfo, np.iinfo

Version 0.34.0
--------------

This release adds a significant set of new features arising from combined work
with Intel on ParallelAccelerator technology. It also adds list comprehension
and closure support, support for Numpy 1.13 and a new, faster, CUDA reduction
algorithm. For Linux users this release is the first to be built on Centos 6,
which will be the new base platform for future releases. Finally a number of
thread-safety, type inference and other smaller enhancements and bugs have been
fixed.


ParallelAccelerator features:

NOTE: The ParallelAccelerator technology is under active development and should
be considered experimental.

The ParallelAccelerator technology is accessed via a new "nopython" mode option
"parallel". The ParallelAccelerator technology attempts to identify operations
which have parallel semantics (for instance adding a scalar to a vector), fuse
together adjacent such operations, and then parallelize their execution across
a number of CPU cores. This is essentially auto-parallelization.

In addition to the auto-parallelization feature, explicit loop based
parallelism is made available through the use of `prange` in place of `range`
as a loop iterator.

More information and examples on both auto-parallelization and `prange` are
available in the documentation and examples directory respectively.

As part of the necessary work for ParallelAccelerator, support for closures
and list comprehensions is added:

* PR #2318: Transfer ParallelAccelerator technology to Numba
* PR #2379: ParallelAccelerator Core Improvements
* PR #2367: Add support for len(range(...))
* PR #2369: List comprehension
* PR #2391: Explicit Parallel Loop Support (prange)

The ParallelAccelerator features are available on all supported platforms and
Python versions with the exceptions of (with view of supporting in a future
release):

* The combination of Windows operating systems with Python 2.7.
* Systems running 32 bit Python.


CUDA support enhancements:

* PR #2377: New GPU reduction algorithm


CUDA support fixes:

* PR #2397: Fix #2393, always set alignment of cuda static memory regions


Misc Fixes:

Version 0.33.0
--------------

This release resolved several performance issues caused by atomic
reference counting operations inside loop bodies.  New optimization
passes have been added to reduce the impact of these operations.  We
observe speed improvements between 2x-10x in affected programs due to
the removal of unnecessary reference counting operations.

There are also several enhancements to the CUDA GPU support:

* A GPU random number generator based on `xoroshiro128+ algorithm <http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/>`_ is added.
  See details and examples in :ref:`documentation <cuda-random>`.
* ``@cuda.jit`` CUDA kernels can now call ``@jit`` and ``@njit``
  CPU functions and they will automatically be compiled as CUDA device
  functions.
* CUDA IPC memory API is exposed for sharing memory between proceses.
  See usage details in :ref:`documentation <cuda-ipc-memory>`.

Reference counting enhancements:

* PR #2346, Issue #2345, #2248: Add extra refcount pruning after inlining
* PR #2349: Fix refct pruning not removing refct op with tail call.
* PR #2352, Issue #2350: Add refcount pruning pass for function that does not need refcount

Version 0.32.0
--------------

In this release, we are upgrading to LLVM 4.0.  A lot of work has been done
to fix many race-condition issues inside LLVM when the compiler is
used concurrently, which is likely when Numba is used with Dask.

Improvements:

* PR #2322: Suppress test error due to unknown but consistent error with tgamma
* PR #2320: Update llvmlite dependency to 0.17
* PR #2308: Add details to error message on why cuda support is disabled.

Version 0.31.0
--------------

In this release, we added preliminary support for debugging with GDB
version >= 7.0. The feature is enabled by setting the ``debug=True`` compiler
option, which causes GDB compatible debug info to be generated.
The CUDA backend also gained limited debugging support so that source locations
are showed in memory-checking and profiling tools.
For details, see :ref:`numba-troubleshooting`.

Also, we added the ``fastmath=True`` compiler option to enable unsafe
floating-point transformations, which allows LLVM to auto-vectorize more code.

Other important changes include upgrading to LLVM 3.9.1 and adding support for
Numpy 1.12.

Version 0.19.2
--------------

This release fixes the source distribution on pypi.  The only change is in the
setup.py file.  We do not plan to provide a conda package as this release is
essentially the same as 0.19.1 for conda users.


Version 0.19.1
--------------

* Issue #1196:

  * fix double-free segfault due to redundant variable deletion in the
    Numba IR (#1195)
  * fix use-after-delete in array expression rewrite pass


Version 0.19.0
--------------

This version introduces memory management in the Numba runtime, allowing to
allocate new arrays inside Numba-compiled functions.  There is also a rework
of the ufunc infrastructure, and an optimization pass to collapse cascading
array operations into a single efficient loop.

.. warning::
   Support for Windows XP and Vista with all compiler targets and support
   for 32-bit platforms (Win/Mac/Linux) with the CUDA compiler target are
   deprecated.  In the next release of Numba, the oldest version of Windows
   supported will be Windows 7.  CPU compilation will remain supported
   on 32-bit Linux and Windows platforms.

Known issues:

* There are some performance regressions in very short running ``nopython``
  functions due to the additional overhead incurred by memory management.
  We will work to reduce this overhead in future releases.

Features:

* Issue #1181: Add a Frequently Asked Questions section to the documentation.
* Issue #1162: Support the ``cumsum()`` and ``cumprod()`` methods on Numpy
  arrays.
* Issue #1152: Support the ``*args`` argument-passing style.
* Issue #1147: Allow passing character sequences as arguments to
  JIT-compiled functions.
* Issue #1110: Shortcut deforestation and loop fusion for array expressions.
* Issue #1136: Support various Numpy array constructors, for example
  numpy.zeros() and numpy.zeros_like().
* Issue #1127: Add a CUDA simulator running on the CPU, enabled with the
  NUMBA_ENABLE_CUDASIM environment variable.
* Issue #1086: Allow calling standard Numpy ufuncs without an explicit
  output array from ``nopython`` functions.
* Issue #1113: Support keyword arguments when calling numpy.empty()
  and related functions.
* Issue #1108: Support the ``ctypes.data`` attribute of Numpy arrays.
* Issue #1077: Memory management for array allocations in ``nopython`` mode.
* Issue #1105: Support calling a ctypes function that takes ctypes.py_object
  parameters.
* Issue #1084: Environment variable NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT disables compilation
  of ``@jit`` functions, instead calling into the Python interpreter
  when called.  This allows easier debugging of multiple jitted functions.
* Issue #927: Allow gufuncs with no output array.
* Issue #1097: Support comparisons between tuples.
* Issue #1075: Numba-generated ufuncs can now be called from ``nopython``
  functions.
* Issue #1062: ``@vectorize`` now allows omitting the signatures, and will
  compile the required specializations on the fly (like ``@jit`` does).
* Issue #1027: Support numpy.round().
* Issue #1085: Allow returning a character sequence (as fetched from a
  structured array) from a JIT-compiled function.

Fixes:

* Issue #1170: Ensure ``ndindex()``, ``ndenumerate()`` and ``ndarray.flat``
  work properly inside generators.
* Issue #1151: Disallow unpacking of tuples with the wrong size.
* Issue #1141: Specify install dependencies in setup.py.
* Issue #1106: Loop-lifting would fail when the lifted loop does not
  produce any output values for the function tail.

  is called with multiple array layouts.
* Issue #1089: Fix range() with large unsigned integers.
* Issue #1088: Install entry-point scripts (numba, pycc) from the conda
  build recipe.
* Issue #1081: Constant structured scalars now work properly.
* Issue #1080: Fix automatic promotion of booleans to integers.


Version 0.18.2

* Issue #1073: Fixes missing template file for HTML annotation
* Issue #1074: Fixes CUDA support on Windows machine due to NVVM API mismatch


Version 0.18.1
--------------

Version 0.18.0 is not officially released.

This version removes the old deprecated and undocumented ``argtypes`` and
``restype`` arguments to the ``@jit`` decorator.  Function signatures
should always be passed as the first argument to ``@jit``.

  Furthermore, some standard attributes on the ``memoryview`` object are
  supported.
* Issue #1030: Support nested arrays in Numpy structured arrays.
* Issue #1033: Implement the inspect_types(), inspect_llvm() and inspect_asm()
  methods for CUDA kernels.

Version 0.17.0
--------------

The major focus in this release has been a rewrite of the documentation.
The new documentation is better structured and has more detailed coverage
of Numba features and APIs.  It can be found online at
http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/index.html

Features:

* Issue #863: CUDA kernels can now infer the types of their arguments
  ("autojit"-like).
* Issue #833: Support numpy.{min,max,argmin,argmax,sum,mean,var,std}

Version 0.16.0
--------------

This release contains a major refactor to switch from llvmpy to `llvmlite <https://github.com/numba/llvmlite>`_
as our code generation backend.  The switch is necessary to reconcile
different compiler requirements for LLVM 3.5 (needs C++11) and Python
extensions (need specific compiler versions on Windows). As a bonus, we have
found the use of llvmlite speeds up compilation by a factor of 2!

Other Major Changes:

* Faster dispatch for numpy structured arrays
* Optimized array.flat()
* Improved CPU feature selection
* Fix constant tuple regression in macro expansion code

Known Issues:

* AVX code generation is still disabled by default due to performance
  regressions when operating on misaligned NumPy arrays.  We hope to have a
  workaround in the future.
* In *extremely* rare circumstances, a `known issue with LLVM 3.5 <http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=21423>`_
  code generation can cause an ELF relocation error on 64-bit Linux systems.


Version 0.15.1
--------------

(This was a bug-fix release that superceded version 0.15 before it was
announced.)

Fixes:

* Workaround for missing __ftol2 on Windows XP.
* Do not lift loops for compilation that contain break statements.
* Fix a bug in loop-lifting when multiple values need to be returned to
  the enclosing scope.
* Handle the loop-lifting case where an accumulator needs to be updated when
  the loop count is zero.

Version 0.15
------------

Features:

* Support for the Python ``cmath`` module.  (NumPy complex functions were
  already supported.)
* Support for ``.real``, ``.imag``, and `.conjugate()`` on non-complex
  numbers.
* Add support for ``math.isfinite()`` and ``math.copysign()``.
* Compatibility mode: If enabled (off by default), a failure to compile in
  object mode will fall back to using the pure Python implementation of the
  function.
* *Experimental* support for serializing JIT functions with cloudpickle.
* Loop-jitting in object mode now works with loops that modify scalars that
  are accessed after the loop, such as accumulators.
* ``@vectorize`` functions can be compiled in object mode.
* Numba can now be built using the `Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 <http://aka.ms/vcpython27>`_
  on Windows platforms.
* CUDA JIT functions can be returned by factory functions with variables in
  the closure frozen as constants.
* Support for "optional" types in nopython mode, which allow ``None`` to be a
  valid value.

Fixes:

* If nopython mode compilation fails for any reason, automatically fall back
  to object mode (unless nopython=True is passed to @jit) rather than raise
  an exeception.
* Allow function objects to be returned from a function compiled in object
  mode.
* Fix a linking problem that caused slower platform math functions (such as
  ``exp()``) to be used on Windows, leading to performance regressions against
  NumPy.
* ``min()`` and ``max()`` no longer accept scalars arguments in nopython mode.
* Fix handling of ambigous type promotion among several compiled versions of a
  JIT function.  The dispatcher will now compile a new version to resolve the
  problem.  (issue #776)
* Fix float32 to uint64 casting bug on 32-bit Linux.
* Fix type inference to allow forced casting of return types.
* Allow the shape of a 1D ``cuda.shared.array`` and ``cuda.local.array`` to be
  a one-element tuple.
* More correct handling of signed zeros.
* Add custom implementation of ``atan2()`` on Windows to handle special cases
  properly.
* Eliminated race condition in the handling of the pagelocked staging area
  used when transferring CUDA arrays.
* Fix non-deterministic type unification leading to varying performance.
  (issue #797)


Version 0.14
------------

Features:

* Support for nearly all the Numpy math functions (including comparison,
  logical, bitwise and some previously missing float functions) in nopython mode.
* The Numpy datetime64 and timedelta64 dtypes are supported in nopython mode
  with Numpy 1.7 and later.
* Support for Numpy math functions on complex numbers in nopython mode.
* ndarray.sum() is supported in nopython mode.
* Better error messages when unsupported types are used in Numpy math functions.
* Set NUMBA_WARNINGS=1 in the environment to see which functions are compiled
  in object mode vs. nopython mode.
* Add support for the two-argument pow() builtin function in nopython mode.
* New developer documentation describing how Numba works, and how to
  add new types.
* Support for Numpy record arrays on the GPU. (Note: Improper alignment of dtype
  fields will cause an exception to be raised.)
* Slices on GPU device arrays.
* GPU objects can be used as Python context managers to select the active
  device in a block.
* GPU device arrays can be bound to a CUDA stream.  All subsequent operations
  (such as memory copies) will be queued on that stream instead of the default.
  This can prevent unnecessary synchronization with other streams.

Fixes:

* Generation of AVX instructions has been disabled to avoid performance bugs
  when calling external math functions that may use SSE instructions,
  especially on OS X.
* JIT functions can be removed by the garbage collector when they are no
  longer accessible.
* Various other reference counting fixes to prevent memory leaks.
* Fixed handling of exception when input argument is out of range.
* Prevent autojit functions from making unsafe numeric conversions when
  called with different numeric types.
* Fix a compilation error when an unhashable global value is accessed.
* Gracefully handle failure to enable faulthandler in the IPython Notebook.
* Fix a bug that caused loop lifting to fail if the loop was inside an
  ``else`` block.
* Fixed a problem with selecting CUDA devices in multithreaded programs on
  Linux.
* The ``pow()`` function (and ``**`` operation) applied to two integers now
  returns an integer rather than a float.
* Numpy arrays using the object dtype no longer cause an exception in the
  autojit.
* Attempts to write to a global array will cause compilation to fall back
  to object mode, rather than attempt and fail at nopython mode.
* ``range()`` works with all negative arguments (ex: ``range(-10, -12, -1)``)

Version 0.13.4
--------------

Features:

* Setting and deleting attributes in object mode
* Added documentation of supported and currently unsupported numpy ufuncs
* Assignment to 1-D numpy array slices
* Closure variables and functions can be used in object mode
* All numeric global values in modules can be used as constants in JIT
  compiled code
* Support for the start argument in enumerate()
* Inplace arithmetic operations (+=, -=, etc.)

  in nopython mode

Fixes:

* Support for NVIDIA compute capability 5.0 devices (such as the GTX 750)
* Vectorize no longer crashes/gives an error when bool\_ is used as return type
* Return the correct dictionary when globals() is used in JIT functions
* Fix crash bug when creating dictionary literals in object

* Increased LLVM optimization of JIT functions to -O1, enabling automatic
  vectorization of compiled code in some cases

  math functions in JIT compiled code on different platforms.
* Importing Numba will no longer throw an exception if the CUDA driver is
  present, but cannot be initialized.

Version 0.12.2
--------------

Fixes:

* Improved NumPy ufunc support in nopython mode
* Misc bug fixes


Version 0.12.1
--------------

This version fixed many regressions reported by user for the 0.12 release.
This release contains a new loop-lifting mechanism that specializes certains
loop patterns for nopython mode compilation.  This avoid direct support
for heap-allocating and other very dynamic operations.

Improvements:

* Add loop-lifting--jit-ing loops in nopython for object mode code. This allows
  functions to allocate NumPy arrays and use Python objects, while the tight
  loops in the function can still be compiled in nopython mode. Any arrays that
  the tight loop uses should be created before the loop is entered.

Fixes:

* Add support for majority of "math" module functions
* Fix for...else handling
* Add support for builtin round()
* Fix tenary if...else support
* Revive "numba" script
* Fix problems with some boolean expressions
* Add support for more NumPy ufuncs


Version 0.12
------------

Version 0.12 contains a big refactor of the compiler. The main objective for
this refactor was to simplify the code base to create a better foundation for
further work. A secondary objective was to improve the worst case performance
to ensure that compiled functions in object mode never run slower than pure
Python code (this was a problem in several cases with the old code base). This
refactor is still a work in progress and further testing is needed.

Main improvements:

* Major refactor of compiler for performance and maintenance reasons
* Better fallback to object mode when native mode fails
* Improved worst case performance in object mode

The public interface of numba has been slightly changed. The idea is to
make it cleaner and more rational:

* jit decorator has been modified, so that it can be called without a signature.
  When called without a signature, it behaves as the old autojit. Autojit
  has been deprecated in favour of this approach.
* Jitted functions can now be overloaded.
* Added a "njit" decorator that behaves like "jit" decorator with nopython=True.
* The numba.vectorize namespace is gone. The vectorize decorator will
  be in the main numba namespace.
* Added a guvectorize decorator in the main numba namespace. It is
  similiar to numba.vectorize, but takes a dimension signature. It
  generates gufuncs. This is a replacement for the GUVectorize gufunc
  factory which has been deprecated.

Main regressions (will be fixed in a future release):

* Creating new NumPy arrays is not supported in nopython mode
* Returning NumPy arrays is not supported in nopython mode
* NumPy array slicing is not supported in nopython mode
* lists and tuples are not supported in nopython mode
* string, datetime, cdecimal, and struct types are not implemented yet
* Extension types (classes) are not supported in nopython mode
* Closures are not supported
* Raise keyword is not supported
* Recursion is not support in nopython mode
