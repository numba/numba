Version 0.5
===========
* SSA-based type inference
    * Allows variable reuse
    * Allow referring to variables before lexical definition
* Support multiple comparisons
* Support for template types
* Support for pointers
* Many bug fixes
* Added user documentation

Version 0.4
===========

Version 0.3
===========
* Changed default compilation approach to ast
* Added support for cross-module linking
* Added support for closures (can jit inner functions and return them) (see examples/closure.py)
* Added support for dtype structures (can access elements of structure with attribute access) (see examples/structures.py)
* Added support for extension types (numba classes) (see examples/numbaclasses.py)
* Added support for general Python code (use nopython to raise an error if Python C-API is used to avoid unexpected slowness because of lack of implementation defaulting to generic Python)
* Fixed many bugs
* Added support to detect math operations. 
* Added with python and with nopython contexts
* Added more examples

Many features need to be documented still.  Look at examples and tests for more information.


Version 0.2
============
* Added an ast approach to compilation
* Removed d, f, i, b from numba namespace (use f8, f4, i4, b1)
* Changed function to autojit2
* Added autojit function to decorate calls to the function and use types of the variable to create compiled versions. 
* changed keyword arguments to jit and autojit functions to restype and argtypes to be consistent with ctypes module.
* Added pycc -- a python to shared library compiler
